# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Aakash Sehgal

I'm a Product Owner with a technical mindset and a passion for building thoughtful, data-informed solutions. I specialize in turning user problems into scalable digital products, often collaborating closely with engineers and designers to bring ideas to life. I come from a QA and technical background, which helps me bridge the gap between business goals and implementation.

Currently working in the EdTech space, I‚Äôve led initiatives that replaced legacy systems, automated dashboards, and reduced operational overhead ‚Äî all while maintaining focus on the end user.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### üìç [PostScope](https://github.com/akagit01/postscope_cur) | [Live Site](https://postscope.netlify.app/)
A personal experiment to validate a product hypothesis:  
> ‚ÄúDo renters and buyers want location-based property insights in one place?‚Äù

I built a landing page using various AI tools (including Cursor AI), hosted it on Netlify, and used Supabase to store and manage data. This project helped me test the idea quickly, gather early feedback, and explore lightweight prototyping to evaluate market interest.

### üîê [DevSecOps-VulnerableCode](https://github.com/akagit01/DevSecOps-VulnerableCode)
My MSc research project on applying DevSecOps practices to insecure codebases. I explored the effectiveness of **SAST**, **DAST**, and **SCA** tools in identifying security vulnerabilities early in the SDLC. The project reinforced the critical importance of shifting security left in the development pipeline and demonstrated how automation can reduce risk and cost.

### üêç [100 Days of Python Code](https://github.com/akagit01/100DaysOfPythonCode)
A self-paced journey to strengthen my Python skills through consistent, hands-on learning.  
While I'm not a developer by trade, I value technical fluency ‚Äî and this project keeps me sharp and curious. I believe a product person with technical empathy is better positioned to make smarter decisions and collaborate more effectively with engineering teams.
